# Glass_Indentification
The dataset contains various features such as refractive index, percentage of different elements like sodium,  magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, and iron, as well as the type of glass. 
The objective of the  project is to build a machine learning model that can effectively identify the type of glass based on these chemical  properties. 
This classification task is crucial in real-world applications, especially in forensic investigations, where identifying the type of glass found at crime scenes can provide valuable evidence. 
By employing various classification algorithms and techniques, the project seeks to achieve high accuracy and robustness in predicting the glass type, thereby contributing to the field of material identification and forensic sciences.
